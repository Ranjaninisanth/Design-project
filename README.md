Leap Disease Detection using Keras and TensorFlow
This project is focused on developing a deep learning model to detect leaf diseases in plants using image classification techniques. By leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model is trained to recognize and classify various types of diseases affecting plant leaves from image data. This can help farmers and agricultural professionals take timely action to prevent crop damage.

The model is built using Python with the Keras API running on top of TensorFlow, offering a flexible and efficient approach for model design and training. The dataset consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves. It undergoes preprocessing including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve model generalization.

The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers, optimized using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The trained model achieves high accuracy and is capable of real-time predictions.

This project contributes to smart agriculture by providing a simple and effective tool for early disease detection. It can be integrated into mobile or web applications for use in the field.
